## Project Overview

My Strength Fitness Tracker is a modern web application designed for fitness enthusiasts who want a clean, efficient way to log and track their workouts. This application focuses on providing a polished user experience with flexible exercise tracking, visual progress insights, and a customizable interface that adapts to user preferences.

### Key Features
- **Hybrid Exercise Support**: Track strength training (sets/reps/weight), cardio (duration/intensity), and other activities (descriptions), without needing to use different apps.
- **Smart Organization**: Weekly workout views with intuitive navigation and editing
- **Visual Progress**: Exercise type distribution charts and weekly progress tracking
- **Personal Goals**: Set individual fitness targets including weight goals, distance targets, and consistency metrics
- **Three Custom Themes**: Professional design system with dark, light, and warm color schemes
- **Comprehensive Statistics**: Session counts, goal tracking, and progress visualization

## Design Process

### Research & Interviewing
I wanted to understand how people currently approach journaling or tracking their workouts, and what makes a tracker feel useful versus overwhelming. I was also looking for insights about which features they find essential and which can be left out.

#### Questions I Asked
- What information feels most important to record for strength training?
- Do you currently track your workouts or activities? If so, how?
- What does "success" mean to you in your fitness goals?

**Key Insights from User Interviews:**
- Users wanted flexibility to track different exercise types in one workout
- Visual progress feedback was highly valued
- Customization options were important for long-term engagement
- Simple, clean interfaces performed better than feature-heavy alternatives

### Sketching & Wireframing
Early design exploration focused on layout and information hierarchy:

![Midpoint Iteration](img/midpoint1.png)
![Another Midpoint Iteration](img/midpoint2.png)
![Final Sketch](img/final-sketch.png)

**Design Iterations:**
1. **Initial Concept**: Single-page form-focused design
2. **First Iteration**: Added tabbed navigation between entry, history, and overview
3. **Final Design**: Clean header navigation with dedicated views for each major function

### User Feedback Integration
User testing revealed key improvements:
- **Navigation**: Users preferred persistent header navigation over tabs
- **Exercise Types**: Mixed workouts needed better visual differentiation
- **Goals**: Personal goal setting was requested as a priority feature
- **Themes**: Multiple color schemes fit to light/dark mode preference

### Mock User Profile

Name: Alex Morgan
Age: 24
Background: College student, works out 3â€“4 times per week, tracks workouts inconsistently in phone notes.
Goals: Wants to improve strength in major lifts, keep better track of progress, and stay consistent week-to-week.
How they use the app:
- Logs workouts immediately after finishing them.
- Tracks sets/reps/weight for main exercises, checks the warmup box, and occasionally adds notes/photos.
- Looks back weekly to see how many sessions they completed.
- Uses the weekly sessions goal feature to stay on track.
- Switches themes occasionally to match their mood.

## Technical Implementation

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend Framework**: Svelte for framing the project
- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development and optimized builds
- **Styling**: Vanilla CSS with CSS custom properties for theming
- **Data Persistence**: Browser localStorage with structured data management

### Architecture Overview
```

â””â”€â”€ app.html                # Base template
```

### Data Management
**Store Architecture:**
```javascript
// Reactive data stores
export const entries = writable([]);
export const weeklyGoal = writable(3);
export const userGoals = writable({
  weightGoal: null,
  monthlyDistanceGoal: null,
  consistencyGoal: 80,
  strengthPRGoal: null,
  cardioTimeGoal: null
});
```

**Workout Data Structure:**
```javascript
{
  id: "timestamp",
  date: "2025-09-22",
  workoutType: "Push (Chest, Shoulders, Triceps)",
  exercises: [
    {
      type: "strength",
      name: "Bench Press",
      sets: 4,
      reps: 8,
      weight: 185
    },
    {
      type: "cardio", 
      name: "Running",
      duration: "30 minutes",
      intensity: "Moderate"
    }
  ],
  warmupCompleted: true,
  notes: "Great session, felt strong",
  photo: null
}
```

### Key Implementation Details

**Reactive Data Flow:**
- Svelte 5 runes (`$state`, `$derived`) for optimal reactivity
- Centralized store management with localStorage persistence
- Real-time UI updates across all components

**Theme System:**
- CSS custom properties for consistent theming
- Dynamic theme switching via body class manipulation
- Persistent theme selection across sessions

**Form Handling:**
- Per-exercise type validation and field management
- Dynamic form structure based on exercise selection
- Comprehensive error handling and user feedback

## Use of AI in Development

**AI Tools Utilized:**
- **GitHub Copilot**: Code inline autocomplete, and debugging
- **ChatGPT**: Problem-solving consultation and abstracted idea generation

**Strengths Observed:**
- **Code Patterns**: Helpful for generating consistent Svelte component patterns when babysat
- **Problem Solving**: Effective for debugging CSS layout and reactivity issues

**Limitations Encountered:**
- **Context Awareness**: AI likes to introduce complex solutions, without accounting for architecture changes (for example, if I was confused on why there was a simple type error, AI would immediately suggest using typescript without actually solving the underlaying problem).
- **Design Decisions**: UI/UX choices required human judgment and user feedback. AI alone cannotâ€”or atleast, should notâ€”fully create an application as it's not based on what best for a human.

## Possible Future Development

### Planned Enhancements
**Phase 1: Enhanced Tracking**
- Progress photos with before/after comparisons over time
- Body measurements tracking integration
- More robust goal tracking options

**Phase 2: Program Management**
- Workout template creation and sharing
- Progressive overload recommendations
- Workout program following (5/3/1, Starting Strength, etc.)
- Calendar integration for workout scheduling

**Phase 3: Mobile App Interface**
- Linked interface with mobile application
- Ability to download from the app store
- Export functionality (PDF reports, CSV data)

### Attempted Features
**Advanced CSS**: Explored various interesting CSS animations, but opted to keep it simpler for speed in both page loading and development time.

**Robust Charting**: Investigated Chart.js integration but opted for custom SVG implementation for better theme integration and smaller bundle size.
